# 2D-The-Apple-and-Flies
A simple 2D game created in 2024 in UCLA Summer Program, Game Lab. 

This is a simple game made in my high school sophomore summer break in UCLA Game Lab. 
The whole thing is super basic since it is for beginner. 
This is my first Github project
So I probably need to figure out how everything works

The game is super easy, 
U can control the apple and shoot with left click
solve the maze and beat the boss
then you win the game
